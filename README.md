# CNN Encrypted
This is code from my work on **Privacy Preserving Malicious Nework Traffic Detection Using Fully Homomorphic CNN** for my MS Thesis. 
It was a great struggle because there is not much information availale about componets used in an Encrypted model and also in this work need for preparing
a new version according to thesis work arised.
This is not very organized code and I will keep working to improve this code in much easy to understand form along with other necessary documents additions.
Some mistakes will still be in code along with improvements chances, so this work will continue.
Kindly check it, improve it and report about the issues so we can all learn more and make it better.
